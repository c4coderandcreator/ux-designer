           <p class="text">
            Our goal is to make community interaction on Roosevelt Island as easy and
            efficient as possible. We are aware that residents may find it challenging and
            time-consuming to use local services, offer feedback, and stay in touch with
            numerous groups. Furthermore, this issue is made all the more difficult by the
            inhabitants' varied demands, preferences, and worries, all of which are subject
            to alter depending on the situation or over time.
            </p>
            <p class="sub-head">• Solution</p>
            <p class="text">
                We did an in-depth study over several months, speaking with the people of
                Roosevelt Island, looking at various platforms, and assessing the special
                qualities of our neighborhood. The five steps of the design thinking process
                that we used were empathized, define, ideate, prototype, and tested. After
                going through this exhaustive procedure, we have a platform that is
                completely functional and has been customized to the resident's particular
                needs and preferences, enhancing their quality of life on the Island. The
                platform is currently in use, but we're not finished. As we continue on our
                path, we intend to add more features and services and improve the platform
                over time to better serve our community.</p>
            <p class="border-side">Residents of Roosevelt Island can interact with community services,
                offer comments, and stay in touch with nearby groups using our
                platform. Our finished solution is a user-friendly, personalized digital
                hub that optimizes access to crucial services and promotes
                intergenerational communication. Our project makes using
                community resources simple and enjoyable, completely altering life
                on Roosevelt Island.</p>
